# Introduction
In this project, I was tasked to perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis for Pewlett Hackard. Using six CSV files containing data about employees from the 1980s and 1990s, I designed the tables, imported the CSV files into a SQL database, and analyzed the data to answer questions about the employees.

# Project Overview
This project was divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis. In the data modeling phase, I sketched an entity relationship diagram of the tables based on the CSV files. In the data engineering phase, I created a table schema for each of the six CSV files, specified data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints, and imported each CSV file into its corresponding SQL table. In the data analysis phase, I used SQL queries to answer various questions about the employees, such as listing their names, departments, and salaries.

# What I Did
I designed the tables based on the CSV files using a tool like QuickDBD, specified data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints, and imported the CSV files into their corresponding SQL tables. Then, I performed various SQL queries to analyze the data, such as listing employee names, departments, and salaries.

# Tools Used
For this project, I used PostgreSQL to create the database and tables, pgAdmin to manage the database and run queries, QuickDBD to sketch an entity relationship diagram of the tables, and SQL queries to analyze the data.

# What I Learned
Through this project, I learned how to design tables based on CSV files, specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints, import CSV files into SQL tables, and perform various SQL queries to analyze the data.

# Conclusion
This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with designing tables, importing data, and performing data analysis using SQL. The results of the data analysis can be found in the SQL_Challenge.sql file in this repository.
